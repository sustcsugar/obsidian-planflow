Refresh the plugin and the task will appear in the calendar and task list.

## Features

### Layout

The plugin uses a **toolbar + content area** layout:

- **Toolbar Left** — View switcher (6 views)
- **Toolbar Center** — Current date range / title
- **Toolbar Right** — Functional buttons (navigation, sort, filter, add task, etc.)

### Task Formats

**Tasks Plugin Format (Emoji)**

```markdown
- [ ] 🎯 Complete project documentation ⏫ ➕ 2025-01-10 📅 2025-01-15
```

| Emoji | Meaning | Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| `🎯` | Global filter marker | `🔺` | Highest priority |
| `⏫` | High priority | `🔼` | Medium priority |
| `🔽` | Low priority | `⏬` | Lowest priority |
| `➕` | Created date | `🛫` | Start date |
| `⏳` | Scheduled date | `📅` | Due date |
| `✅` | Completion date | `❌` | Cancelled date |
| `🔁` | Recurring task | - | - |

**Dataview Plugin Format (Inline Fields)**

```markdown
- [ ] 🎯 Complete project documentation [priority:: high] [created:: 2025-01-10] [due:: 2025-01-15]
```

| Field | Meaning | Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| `priority::` | Priority | `created::` | Created date |
| `start::` | Start date | `scheduled::` | Scheduled date |
| `due::` | Due date | `completion::` | Completion date |
| `cancelled::` | Cancelled date | `repeat::` | Recurrence rule |

**Time Precision**

- Date: `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2026-04-27`)
- Time: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm` (e.g., `2026-04-27 14:00`)
- Tasks with time automatically display in timeline layout

**Recurring Task Syntax**

```markdown
🔁 every day              # Every day
🔁 every 3 days           # Every 3 days
🔁 every week on Monday   # Every Monday
🔁 every month on 15      # Every month on the 15th
🔁 every year on 01-01    # Every year on Jan 1
🔁 every weekday          # Every weekday
🔁 when done              # Restart after completion
```

### Year View

- **Year Overview** — 12 month cards showing full-year task distribution
- **Task Heatmap** — 5-level color gradient for task density
  - 8 palette options: blue / green / red / purple / orange / cyan / pink / yellow
  - 3D heatmap effect (off / slight / prominent)
- **Responsive Layout** — Auto-switches between 4×3 / 3×4 / 2×6 / 1×12 grids
- **Task Count** — Optional per-day task total display
- **Lunar Calendar** — Chinese lunar dates in month cards
- **Click Navigation** — Click a date to switch to Day View

### Month View

- **Monthly Calendar** — Standard month grid layout with daily tasks
- **Week Numbers** — ISO week numbers shown in the first column
- **Task Display Limit** — Configurable per-day task count (1–10) with "+N more" overflow
- **Task Popup** — Click a date to view all tasks for that day
- **Festival Display** — Solar/lunar/solar-term festivals with distinct colors
- **Drag & Drop** — Drag task cards between days to reschedule
- **Recurring Tasks** — Virtual instances for repeating tasks
- **Week Start** — Configurable Monday or Sunday start

### Week View

- **Continuous Time Canvas** — Always-on 24-hour timeline (no more list/timeline mode switching); task blocks positioned by the minute (1h = 50px), hour + half-hour grid lines
- **Smart Task Blocks** — Blocks sized by actual duration:
  - Single-time tasks render as 1-hour point blocks anchored by field role (start-field → forward `[t, t+60)`, due-field → backward `[t-60, t)`)
  - Same-day intervals render at true size; overnight intervals (<24h) span columns with continuation arrows
  - Multi-day tasks (≥24h) move to the all-day row as spanning bars with time annotations (`"22:00 → 18:00"`)
  - Text wraps to multiple lines within block bounds (block is master, text is servant)
- **All-Day Row** — Date-only tasks + ≥24h spanning bars, unlimited lane rows with `+N` collapse beyond 3
- **Click-to-Create** — Click any empty canvas spot to create a task at that time (15-min snap); drag vertically to pre-select a range
- **Edge Resize** — Drag block top/bottom edges to adjust start/end (15-min snap, Alt = 5-min fine-tune); resizing a point task upgrades it to an interval
- **WYSIWYG Drag & Drop** — Landing anchored to block edges (not cursor) with drop preview; dropping a point task writes both start & end
- **Overlap Lanes** — Up to 3 side-by-side columns; 4th+ stacks with shadow
- **Mobile** — 3-day sliding window with horizontal swipe
- **Today Highlight** — Current day emphasized; current time indicator line
- **Lunar Info** — Lunar dates and festivals in day headers

### Day View

- **Continuous Time Canvas** — Same timeline semantics as Week View (minute-positioned blocks, edge resize, click-to-create, drop preview, multi-line text)
- **All-Day Section** — Date-only tasks + ≥24h spanning bars with time annotations; drop here to convert to all-day
- **Drag & Drop** — Block-edge-anchored with landing preview; point tasks upgrade to intervals on drop
- **Current Time Indicator** — Red line at the current time
- **Daily Note Integration**
  - Embedded full editor (WorkspaceSplit mode)
  - Edit / Preview mode toggle
  - Auto-loads daily note for the selected date
  - Supports Obsidian core daily notes, Periodic Notes plugin, and custom paths
- **Resizable Split** — Draggable divider between task and note panes (horizontal or vertical layout)
- **Lunar Info Bar** — Lunar date, festivals, and solar terms

### Task View

- **Task List** — Centralized display of all tasks
- **Date Range Filter** — All / Today / This Week / This Month / Custom range
- **Time Field Selector** — Filter by any of 6 date fields
- **Multi-dimensional Filtering** — Status, priority, and tags (AND/OR/NOT operators)
- **Sorting** — 7 sort fields with asc/desc toggle
- **Persistent State** — Filter and sort settings persist across refreshes
- **Recurring Tasks** — Virtual instances for repeating tasks are expanded and sorted by date

### Gantt View

- **Tag & Status Filtering** — Filter gantt bars by tags and status
- **Configurable Fields** — Choose which date fields map to gantt start/end
- **Time-Aligned** — Day-granularity grid aligned with calendar view semantics; touch-friendly handles (22px hit area); bar-end time annotations

### Sidebar View

Two-tab sidebar for quick task access:

**Task List Tab**
- Keyword search (debounced)
- Multi-dimensional filters: status, priority, tags (OR/AND), date range
